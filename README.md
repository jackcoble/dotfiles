# Dotfiles
The repository contains my dotfiles and scripts for my Void Linux machines.

## Usage
I manage my dotfiles using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), so installation of the dotfiles is as simple as running the following from my dotfiles directory.

```bash
stow *
```

## Additional Packages
Here is a list of common packages I install on my Void Linux system to get it running:

```
xorg-minimal
